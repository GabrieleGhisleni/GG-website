                    I maintain a repository that functions as a website, serving as an up-to-date record of my
                    continuous studies and expertise in various subjects.
                    <br/>
                    This platform offers an extensive portfolio, showcasing both my projects and comprehensive
                    documentation of the topics I've thoroughly delved into and mastered throughout my professional
                    journey. &nbsp;
